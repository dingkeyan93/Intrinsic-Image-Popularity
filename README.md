This is a PyTorch implementation of the paper [*Intrinsic Image Popularity Assessment*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01985).

This work can objectively and quantitatively predict how much traction an image will get on Instagram. 
It can help users to find the image that would be the most popular to the public.
